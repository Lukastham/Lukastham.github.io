Based on the data collected from my own personal preferences, survey has been done with my close friends to understand what influences users' preferences on phone choices.

Based on the data collected, we can see that the younger and those with lower income tends to choose Samsung over iPhone, while those earning more than $4,200 tends to prefer iPhone over Samsung.

Therefore, we can conclude that the more you earn, the more you tend to choose an iPhone over a Samsung phone.
