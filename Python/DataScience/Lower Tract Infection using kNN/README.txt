The data was collected based on a survey result done personally to understand whether factors such as BMI, Flu like symptoms, Fever and Smoking plays a major role in causing Lower Tract Infection. 

The data was pre-processed into a numpy array to allow us to use the scikit learn library. From there, the kNN library was utilised to understand the data and to understand the accuracy of the data.

Thank you for your time
