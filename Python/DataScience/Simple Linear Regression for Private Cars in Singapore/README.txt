Extracting the annual motor vehicles data on data.gov.sg, I analysed whether the number of private cars in the category "Cars & Station Wagons" are increasing or decreasing.

Based on the graph and visualisation, I found that the number has been increasing as I plotted the best-fit line on the graph to understand whether there is a trend of increasing or decreasing.

To conclude, I found that the trend of the number of private cars on the road are constantly increasing. Therefore, through the analysis, there is a strong cause for the increasing of private cars on the road from 2006 - 2014, and the trend will continue to increase.
